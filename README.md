# Microbiome Diversity Analysis with QIIME2 and ANCOMBC

The primary focus of this project is to understand how microbiome diversity varies across genotypes, ages, and disease progression, using various diversity metrics and statistical methods.

## üß™ Analyses Performed

### 1. **Alpha Diversity** (Shannon Index)
- Calculated the **Shannon diversity index** to measure within-sample diversity for different genotypes and ages.
- Visualized using boxplots to compare diversity across different **genotypes** and **ages**.

### 2. **Beta Diversity** (Bray-Curtis)
- Performed **Bray-Curtis dissimilarity** calculations to compare microbiome composition between samples.
- Visualized using **Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA)**, with colors indicating different **genotypes**.

### 3. **PERMANOVA**
- Conducted a **PERMANOVA test** to assess statistical differences in microbiome composition between groups.
- Used **genotype** as a grouping variable to identify significant effects.
- The output includes a test statistic (`pseudo-F`) and a p-value to determine if the groups are significantly different.

### 5. **ANCOMBC (Analysis of Composition of Microbiomes with Bias Correction)**
- **ANCOMBC** was used to identify differentially abundant taxa between groups (genotype, age).
- Multiple comparisons were made, and differential abundance results were visualized through **barplots** and **significance plots**.
- The results help identify which taxa show significant differences based on genotype and age, shedding light on microbiome shifts due to AD progression.

## üì• Data

To run the analyses, you will need the following data:

- **`metadata.txt`**: Metadata file containing information about the samples, including genotype, age, and individual IDs.
- **`shannon.qza`**: Alpha diversity output (Shannon Index).
- **`distance-matrix.qza`**: Bray-Curtis distance matrix.
- **`pcoa.qza`**: PCoA coordinates for beta diversity visualization.
- **`ancombc.qza`**: ANCOMBC differential abundance results.

## üìã Instructions

1. **Prepare Data**: Ensure that all the necessary files (`.qza`, `.txt`) are in the correct format and available.
2. **Run Scripts**:
   - Execute the R scripts for **alpha diversity** (`alpha_beta_diversity.R`) and **ANCOMBC** (`ancombc_analysis.R`).
3. **Review Outputs**: Review the plots and statistical tests generated in the **results/ folder**.
4. **Interpret Results**: Use the **PERMANOVA**, and **ANCOMBC** outputs to understand the microbiome‚Äôs response to different **genotypes** and **ages**.
